        </div>
        <div class="section-content light">
            <p>I am a User Experience Designer from Erie, Pennsylvania. With a
                BA in Graphic Design, I bring a strong sense of visual design, coupled with an aptitude and passion for
                front-end development to my work.</p>

            <p>As a former college athlete, I bring skills of teamwork and leadership to the table.
                Coaching and
                mentoring those around me has become a passion of mine. During 5+ years working at a Fortune 500
                company, I have designed
                web applications that deliver strong business value. </p>

            <p>Continuing to learn new skills has become habitual for me. Early on in my career I developed an interest
                in front-end
                engineering. I feel being able to write and understand front-end languages is a huge advantage for a
                user experience designer.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Strategy
                    <p>Often times I see designers and project teams jumping right into design and development without
                        enough consideration for a design strategy. At one point in my career, I fit
                        this description. However, as I have grown I have seen the importance of
                        strategy. Before starting a project, I like to consider all stakeholders and encourage them to
                        break out of their segmented thinking. If possible, I like to use design sprints and working
                        sessions to learn about the different users, applications involved, the architecture and any
                        other relevant information. Strategy sessions have helped me to generate conceptual designs and
                        prototypes as well as shedding light on areas where we may need to conduct research and
                        analysis. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Research & analysis
                    <p>User research & analysis is an extremely important input to my design process.
                        Understanding a user's behavior and mental model has allowed me to create designs focused on the
                        user's actual needs and not just their perceived ones. Performing contextual interviews,
                        observing
                        users, and competitor analysis are all effective methods of user research that I have used
                        to inform my designs.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Design & ideation
                    <p>Starting with a pen and paper is always my preferred method when generating ideas for a complex
                        workflow.
                        While working on commercial insurance applications, I often encounter complex business
                        workflows, and writing out all the possible scenarios helps me to organize my thoughts and
                        consider the workflow without fixating on a solution too early. Once I have some high level
                        conceptual sketches, I will work to develop some more detailed
                        designs and prototypes. I mainly work with Sketch, inVision, and Axure RP. Peer review is
                        extremely important for me, and I always look for feedback from my fellow designers and
                        front-end developers. I will share my designs with engineers and key business partners involved
                        in the project to
                        gain buy-in. Once everyone involved has agreed on the design, I will polish up the design or
                        prototype and prepare it to share with the engineer building the feature.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Development
                    <p>Working with developers is crucial to being a good user experience designer, and understanding
                        front-end development has been a great tool for me. Once the designs have been
                        finished, I will pass the specs over to the engineer, but the work simply cannot stop there.
                        Follow up conversations are always needed. I often find myself working with developers to
                        implement the solution and to make adjustments while development is happening. Things don't
                        always go as planned, so making sure that the lines of communication are open with the
                        engineering team is a must do.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Usability testing & evaluation
                    <p>Testing designs with actual users is arguably the most important part of user-experience and
                        user-centered design. I can design something aesthetically beautiful that makes
                        sense to the entire project team, but until I get it in front of an actual user, I don't know if
                        the design works. Validating workflows with users is an integral part of my design process. I
                        write test scripts and perform task-based analysis of my designs with users to gain insight
                        into their thought process while they use the application. I ask users to think out loud while I probe
                        about workflows that I want to get feedback on. After testing (usually with 5 users), I analyze
                        the results and compile reports with my design recommendations. Testing before releasing
                        features to production allows us to make updates for better workflows and designs before users
                        struggle and get frustrated. </p>
