            <p>This project is currently the largest IT initiative at my company. The goal is to build an
                industry leading quoting and application system for our independent agent force. My role is Lead User
                Experience Designer. We were tasked with adding a new commercial product that combines 7 products
                into one, that agents can sell as a business package policy. Additionally we are enabling
                agents with the ability to digitally service their policies. This includes making policy changes,
                billing changes,
                and accessing claims information.</p>
            <p><b>Project Goal:</b> Enhance current quote and application system design and workflow. Add new package
                product that combines 7 products into one, while adding
                full policy servicing capabilities. </p>
            <p><b>Team:</b> 100+ team members from Product Development, Project Management, Business Analysis,
                Engineering,
                Quality Assurance, Data Analysis, Underwriting, Policy Processing, Billing, and Business sponsorship.

            <h1>Customer</h1>
            <p>The workflow starts with collecting information about the prospective customer the agent is
                completing the quote for. Simple form layout helps guide the agent through the data entry.</p>

            <h1>Products</h1>
            <p>Next the agent can add multiple products to quote at the same time. I chose to make the 'Add product'
                buttons large tiles matching the size of the products already added, to indicate how additional products
                would progressively fill out the screen. A common 'Customer Account' would consist of 4 products which
                would evenly fill the viewport.</p>

            <p>The primary location entered on the Customer page is pre-populated on the Locations page. Agents
                can then add multiple locations or buildings at a location here. The location and building count is
                shown at the top of the tab list for middle market policies that have a lot of locations and buildings.
